# Microsoft Office Telemetry Parser for Autopsy

## Overview

In Office 2013, Microsoft introduced telemetry collection in Office. This created a gold mine of data for digital forensics examiners.

Included in Office telemetry collection are:
* File name
* User name
* File open/close date/times
* File size
* Document title
* Document author
* Office version
* Last loaded date/times

This ingest module searches for folders containing all three of the files sln.tbl, user.tbl, and evt.tbl. It then combines the data from these 3 files and outputs artifacts to the blackboard as type TSK_RECENT_OBJECT.

## Usage

Unzip all files from the repo into an unique folder in the Autopsy Python directory.
