# Autopsy 3rd Party Module Repository

This repository contains the 3rd party add-on modules to the [Autopsy Digital Forensics Platform](http://www.autopsy.com). Each module has a folder in the repository that contains a README file. Some of the modules are stored in this repository and others are hosted on another site with a link in its README.

## How To Use The Site

1. Find the module that meets your needs  
2. Download and install it

## Finding A Module

The modules in the repository are organized by their type.

- **Ingest modules** analyze files as they are added to the case. This is the most common type of module.  
- **Content viewer modules** are in the lower right corner of Autopsy and they display a file or selected item in some way.  
- **Report modules** run at the end of the analysis and can generate various types of reports (or can do various types of analysis).  
- **Data source processors** allow for different types of data sources to be added to a case.

Each module has its own folder with a `README.md` file that outlines the basics of what the module does.

You can either navigate the folder structure or use the [Search](https://sleuthkit.github.io/autopsy_addon_modules/) page that will search the contents of the README files.

## Downloading A Module

2. You can download specific modules from the site.  
   This is easier for Java NBM modules than it is for Python modules, which may contain a number of files.
